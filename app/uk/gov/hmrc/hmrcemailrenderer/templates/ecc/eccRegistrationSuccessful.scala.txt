Use the Customs Declaration Service

We have subscribed you to the Customs Declaration Service. This means you can do things like:

- submit import and export declarations using your customs declaration software
- pay Customs Duty and import VAT
- get your postponed import VAT statements

For more information, search 'Customs Declaration Service' on GOV.UK.
} else {
@dynamicSubscriptionContent

- get an EORI number starting with XI

}
If you move goods to or from Northern Ireland

If you do not have an EU EORI number you will need to get an EORI number starting with XI.

To get an EORI number starting with XI, search ‘get an EORI number’ on GOV.UK.
